Small command line program for converting json (and any text) file to C header file.

Use:
json2h jsonfile.json OPTIONS
    -r or --reduce
        removes from source input all chars with code <= 0x20 to reduce header file size
    -c or --colsize VALUE
        set item count on each line of result array, default is 12.
    -d or --deletecomments
        deletes source file as comment in result header file

Examples of usage:
    ./json2h test.json (produce non-reduced output with 12 items on each row)
    ./json2h -c 15 -r test.json (produce reduced output with 15 items on each row)
    ./json2h test.json -r -c 0 (produce reduced output with one long line)
    ./json2h test.json -r -d (produce reduced output, source file did not included into result file)

Result of program work will JSON_FILE_NAME.h file in the same directory (if file exists it will be overwritten).

Binaries for different (Linux and Windows) placed into bin/ folder, binaries contains all necessary libraries for start.
